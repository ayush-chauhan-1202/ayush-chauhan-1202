👋 Hi, I’m Ayush

Industrial Computer Vision | Physics-aware Machine Learning | X-ray & CT | Applied Deep Learning

I’m an applied ML practitioner with a strong foundation in Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) and physics-based imaging systems, currently working at GE Aerospace Research. My work sits at the intersection of:
	•	🔬 Physics-based modeling
	•	🤖 Deep learning & machine learning
	•	👁️ Computer vision for industrial inspection
	•	⚙️ Practical, production-minded ML systems

I specialize in solving real-world imaging problems—not just benchmark datasets.

	•	Defect detection & segmentation in industrial imagery
	•	End-to-end ML pipelines (training → evaluation → inference)
	•	Scientific Python (NumPy, PyTorch, OpenCV, CuPy)
